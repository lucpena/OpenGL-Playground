# OpenGL-Playground

A learning enviroment that's always been updated as I learn and develop more features. By now, it has the following features: a moving camera, textures, ambient light, diffuse light, specular light, point light, use of .obj models, directional light shadows, omnishadows (from point and spot lights) and skybox.
